If this encounter occurs while the characters are traveling,
they spot 2d6 zorbos (see appendix D) in wukka
trees (see appendix C). The creatures growl and bare
their teeth if any characters approach them. If the characters
act in a threatening manner, the zorbos attack.
If this encounter occurs while the party is camped,
the hungry zorbos drop from the surrounding trees
and attack
